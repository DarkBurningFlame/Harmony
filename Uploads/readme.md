Looking for the files to run Flames? 
You probably want to go to the Releases page and get the latest zip from there.

However, you can still download the required files from here. You need these files:
Flames.exe, FlamesCLI.exe, Flames_.dll

The dev file is a special form of Flames being developed to have backwards compatibility with the other cores: 
[RandomStrangers](https://github.com/RandomStrangers/RandomStrangers), 
[SuperNova](https://github.com/RandomStrangers/SuperNova), 
[RelaySoftware](https://github.com/RandomStrangers/RelaySoftware), 
[DeadNova](https://github.com/RandomStrangers/DeadNova), and
[GoldenSparks](https://github.com/RandomStrangers/Sparkie). 
This is still in development! Plugins from other cores will not work yet!
